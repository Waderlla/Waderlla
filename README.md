## About Me
I learn best by doing - testing, iterating, and building from scratch. My journey into data started with Python, but I quickly realized that the foundations matter most: **clean data, clear visuals, and sharp insights**. That’s why my focus is on clarity, logic, and solutions that make sense.

## Beyond Data
Outside of analytics, I’m a mom of energetic twins - my best teachers of adaptability, time management, and problem-solving under pressure. These everyday skills translate directly into my data work: flexibility, creativity, and staying focused despite challenges.
